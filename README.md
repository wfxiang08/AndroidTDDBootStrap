An Android TDD bootstrap project, use a collection of new technology, obey best practices, inspired from some popular architectures, develop with many handy tools.

## Why another bootstrap project?
From the beginning of this year 2015, our team start a new project, and before we develop functionality in detail, we try to create a well-architecture project from scratch, with well designed network layer, data layer, asynchronous execution, communication between modules, and last but not least: unit test and integrate test support. After several months of developing, we found some drawback of our current architecture, and also found some popular architectures, then I decide to extract our original well designed architecture and open source it, with amendment according to the drawback and features from new popular architectures we found.
Recently I have seen a lot of bootstrap/base Android project, including [JakeWharton's u2020](https://github.com/JakeWharton/u2020), [mobiwiseco's Android-Base-Project](https://github.com/mobiwiseco/Android-Base-Project), etc, but none of these projects cover all features I include in this AndroidTDDBootStrap project. That's why I want more people to see this repo, and I also want get feedback from more people to improve this project.

## Architecture
Based on the project architecture I'm currently work on, [YOLO](https://www.yoloyolo.tv/), and inspired from popular architectures: [Android Clean Architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture), [Against Android Unit Tests: The Square way](http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/04/10/against-android-unit-tests/).

## Project structure
+  base
  +  The so called architecture part, and base classes, best practice, etc.
+  model
  +  Business related data layer, entities, APIs, DAOs, etc.
+  app
  +  App functionality.
+  package organization
  +  package by layer v.s. package by feature, read more about the [Package organization part of this blog](http://fernandocejas.com/2015/07/18/architecting-android-the-evolution/), and [Package by feature, not layer](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=205).
  +  package by layer + package by feature
    +  network API, data object, DAO are organized in the single `model` library module, but inside model module, classes are organized by feature
    +  app functionality are organized by feature, mvp, di, ui code are organized together

## Build tips
+  Sign key config

    Place KeyStore file in some place, and create a TemplateKeyStore.properties, and config the KeyStore in it, include `keystore`, `keystore.password`, `key.password`, `key.alias`.
+  To clone all submodules, please use `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Piasy/AndroidTDDBootStrap.git`  

## Dev tips
+  Create utils
  +  Create util class in common/common_android module
  +  Add @Provides annotated provider method in corresponding Module class(UtilsModule.java/AndroidUtilsModule.java)
  +  ~~Add expose method in AppComponent.java~~
+  Create Activity
+  Unit test
  +  use the check*.sh script in buildsystem dir
+  Run `./buildsystem/ci.sh` before git push.

## Todo
+  ~~CheckStyle~~
+  ~~re-arch the provider package~~
+  ~~Espresso test of presentation module~~
+  ~~refactor AppComponent~~
+  ~~facebook [BUCK](http://buckbuild.com) integration~~ integrate with [OkBuck](https://github.com/Piasy/OkBuck)
+  ~~Update dependencies~~
+  refactor modules
+  NDK integrate
+  MVP source generator plugin
+  MVVM branch
+  react native branch
+  kotlin branch
